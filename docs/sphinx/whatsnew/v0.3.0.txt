v0.3.0 (2016)
-----------------------

This is a major release from 0.2.2.
It will almost certainly break your code, but it's worth it!
We recommend that all users upgrade to this version after testing
their code for compatibility and updating as necessary.


API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

* The ``location`` argument in ``solarposition.get_solarposition``
  and ``clearsky.ineichen``
  has been replaced with ``latitude``, ``longitude``,
  ``altitude``, and ``tz`` as appropriate.
  This separates the object-oriented API from the procedural API.
  (:issue:`17`)
* ``Location`` classes gain the ``get_solarposition``, ``get_clearsky``,
  and ``get_airmass`` functions.
* Adds ``ModelChain``, ``PVSystem``, ``LocalizedPVSystem``,
  ``SingleAxisTracker``, and ``LocalizedSingleAxisTracker``
  classes. (:issue:`17`)
* ``Location`` objects can be created from TMY2/TMY3 metadata
  using the ``from_tmy`` constructor.
* Change default ``Location`` timezone to ``'UTC'``.
* The solar position calculators now assume UTC time if the input time
  is not localized. The calculators previously tried to infer the timezone
  from the now defunct location argument.
* ``pvsystem.sapm_celltemp`` argument names now follow the
  variable conventions.
* ``irradiance.total_irrad`` now follows the variable conventions.
  (:issue:`105`)


Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added new sections to the documentation:

    * :ref:`package_overview`
    * :ref:`variables_style_rules`
    * :ref:`classes`

* Adds support for Appveyor, a Windows continuous integration service.
  (:issue:`111`)
* The readthedocs documentation build now uses conda packages
  instead of mock packages. This enables code to be run
  and figures to be generated during the documentation builds.
  (:issue:`104`)
* Reconfigures TravisCI builds and adds e.g. ``has_numba`` decorators
  to the test suite. The result is that the TravisCI test suite runs
  almost 10x faster and users do not have to install all optional
  dependencies to run the test suite. (:issue:`109`)
* Adds more unit tests that test that the return values are
  actually correct.
* Add ``atmosphere.APPARENT_ZENITH_MODELS`` and
  ``atmosphere.TRUE_ZENITH_MODELS`` to enable code that can
  automatically determine which type of zenith data to use
  e.g. ``Location.get_airmass``.


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed the metadata key specification in documentation of the
  ``readtmy2`` function.
* Fixes the import of tkinter on Python 3 (:issue:`112`)
